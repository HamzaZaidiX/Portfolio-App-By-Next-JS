## [React Bricks](https://reactbricks.com/):

The [**React Bricks**](https://reactbricks.com/) is for developers to make apps create visually editable blocks as React components for **Next.js, Gatsby, Remix** in just not more **5 mins** and `create, customize and edit` your app and **deploy your App** in just few mins. All the advantages of a **headless CMS**, but your users will love it.
